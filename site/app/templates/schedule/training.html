			<p>The class will cover different types of e-textiles, basic circuits and a 
				beginner level project. Participants will receive an Aniomagic Sparkle Kit,
				which will be used to learn how to sew circuits into fabric.  No previous
				sewing experience is necessary.
			</p>
			<p>Sparkle is an avant-garde way to make interactive textiles, paper, ceramics, 
				and environments. Change the way it works directly from a web browser by 
				holding it in front of a computer screen or smartphone. Participants will 
				need no programming experience to program the sparkle board. We strongly 
				recommend bringing your own Mac/Linux/Windows laptop will allow you more 
				time to change the programming. Scraps of fabric will be available to use 
				during the class; however, it is recommended that participants bring an item 
				that they would like to use for their project (ex. shirt, hat, bag).
			</p>
			<p>Here is a link to some examples of how others have created with the Aniomagic 
				kits <a href="http://www.aniomagic.com/gallery/" target="_blank">http://www.aniomagic.com/gallery/</a>
			</p>
			<p>There will be a charge of approximately $30 for the Aniomagic Sparkle Kits 
				that will be paid at the time of registration.  You may also acquire and 
				bring your own Aniomagic Sparkle Kit.

			<p>2013 and 2014 taught us that any organization can be targeted by hackers, 
				regardless of size or function. We all have to plan for security incidents 
				from ransomware to defacement, hacktivism to nation state actors. You’ve set 
				up security devices and built a monitoring program, but you still aren’t certain 
				what to do if a crisis hits. This course will cover the basics of building incident 
				response skills and an incident response program for organizations with 20-20,000 
				employees. Even if you can’t dedicate an employee to incident response, you can 
				still prepare for a security incident.

			<p>As developers, we focus on the utility and usability of the systems we build, 
				as we should. There is another consideration, though, and that is the criminal 
				element and its access to our systems. The most utile and usable system is 
				dangerous to deploy without appropriate security controls in place. In this 
				four hour bootcamp, you’ll get a look at the security principles that will keep 
				your applications more secure and learn to test for specific vulnerabilities. 
				The session will cover Authentication and Content Management, Injection 
				Vulnerabilities, Cracking and Fixing REST APIs, and Information Disclosure. 
				This is a hands on session, so make sure to download Samurai WTF for excercises.

			<p>“Threat Intelligence” is more than a vendor buzzword. Lists of IP Addresses and 
				Domain Names deemed “bad” are not Threat Intelligence. Threat Intelligence is becoming 
				a serious business need for organizations looking to reduce their risk profile by 
				getting out in front of threats and limit impact. This course is special for CircleCityCon, 
				it is a high-level, introductory overview of what Threat Intelligence Management Programs 
				are and the intent of such programs. We will walk through the Open Source Intelligence 
				ecosystem, Signal Intelligence collection, management and analysis efforts, Threat 
				Intelligence Management, business and technical requirements of Threat Intelligence 
				Programs, supporting business processes, and the operationalization of analysis efforts. 
				This course is aimed at understanding how to leverage information from attacks occurring 
				around the Internet, how those trends can be collected, aggregated, analyzed and more 
				importantly “how to keep yourself from winding up on the Krebs’ list."

				presented in 3 parts: Building hard skills that are applicable to the

				building soft social skills to create and fan relationships you can 
				leverage to future benefit, and finally a section on proper resume building 
				geared primarily towards IT & InfoSec. Remember: whether you think you

			<p>Android apps are very insecure—-80% of the ones I’ve tested have 
				serious vulnerabilities. It’s simple to test for common 
				vulnerabilities with a few free tools: Android Studio, Genymotion, 
				Burp, and apktool. 
			</p>
			<p>Students must bring laptops. Macs work best, but PCs can also be 
				used. Linux works better than Windows. Students will set up their 
				laptops, find vulnerabilities in real apps, and exploit them. 
			</p>
			<p>We will test for insecure network transmission, insecure local 
				storage, and insecure logging. But the most common problem is failure 
				to verify app signatures, so that apps can be modified and Trojan code 
				can be added. Students will do that to a real financial app, creating 
				a proof-of-concept that leaks out private data such as username and 
				password.
