<h4>Press Expectations:</h4>
<p>CircleCityCon requests all attendees, including press and sponsors respect the personal privacy of all conference attendees. This includes taking photographs and/or videos of attendees without permission or revealing the identity of attendees without their permission.  Violators may be removed from the conference and future access to the event may be limited.</p>
<p>The following guidelines should be followed when operating in an official media capacity:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify yourself as press or media via the conference badge.</li>
	<li>Give a verbal introduction of who you are, where you work for, and how the information will be used.</li>
	<li>Receive consent before beginning any type of interview and receive consent for using an attendee’s name (real or pseudonym) in video, audio, or written publication.</li>
	<li>Ensure you receive permission before recording, quoting, or taking a picture of anyone… this includes people in the background.</li>
	<li>Official talk recordings and photographs may be used or linked by media members. Full credit to the speaker, videographer, and the event must be given.</li> 
	<li>Any non-official footage, including audio and photographs, must receive permission from the Presenter(s) first (in our experience, most speakers will gladly allow permission to use their talks) before publication, unless it is the official recording of the talk.  Full credit to the speaker and the event must be given.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any violation of these policies may result in removal from the event and limited access to future events.</p>
